Notes:

FORWARD CHECKING

One of the simplest forms of inference is called forward checking. Whenever
a variable X is assigned, the forward-checking process establishes arc
consistency for it: for each unassigned variable Y that is connected to X
by a constraint, delete from Y â€™s domain any value that is inconsistent
with the value chosen for X. Because forward checking only does arc
consistency inferences, there is no reason to do forward checking if we
have already done arc consistency as a preprocessing step.

ARC CONSISTENCY

AC-3(csp):

	queue = [] # queue of arcs, initially all in csp

	while queue.notEmpty() :

		(x_i, x_j) = queue.pop()

		if revise(csp, x_i, x_j): # have we reduced the domain of x_i
			if size(x_i.domain) == 0: 
				return false # inconsistency found
			for x_k in x_i.neighbours - {x_j}:
				queue.add((x_k, x_i))

	return True # no inconsistencies found

REVISE(csp, var1, var2):

	revised = False
	y_satisfies = False

	for x in var1.domain:
		for y in var2.domain:
			constraint_soln = (x,y)
			y_satisfies = check_if_constraint_satisfied(var1, var2, constraint_soln)
			if (y_satisfies):
				break
		if (!y_satisfies):
			var1.domain.delete(x) # reduce var1's domain!
			revised = True
		y_satisfies = False
	return revised


VARIABLE:

       (a) It has a current domain, implimented as a set of flags 
           determining which domain values are "current", i.e., unpruned.
           - you can prune a value, and restore it.
           - you can obtain a list of values in the current domain, or count
             how many are still there

       (b) But conceptually when a variable is assigned it only has
           the assigned value in its current domain (viewing it this
           way makes implementing the propagators easier). [[[Hence, when
           the variable is assigned, the 'cur_domain' returns the
           assigned value as the sole member of the current domain]]],
           and [[['in_cur_domain' returns True only for the assigned
           value]]]. However, the internal state of the current domain
           flags are not changed so that [[[pruning and unpruning can
           work independently of assignment and unassignment]]].
